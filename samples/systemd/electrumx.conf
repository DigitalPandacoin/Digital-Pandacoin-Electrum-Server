#These following environment variables are to help limit server
#resource consumption and to prevent simple DoS.  Address subscriptions
#in ElectrumX are very cheap - they consume about 100 bytes of memory
#each and are processed efficiently.  I feel the defaults are low and
#encourage you to raise them.

    #MAX_SUBS = 250000
        #Maximum number of address subscriptions across all sessions
    #MAX_SESSION_SUBS = 50000
        #Maximum number of address subscriptions permitted to a single session.


#If synchronizing from the Genesis block your performance might change
#by tweaking the following cache variables.  Cache size is only checked
#roughly every minute, so the caches can grow beyond the specified
#size.  Also the Python process is often quite a bit fatter than the
#combined cache size, because of Python overhead and also because
#leveldb consumes a lot of memory during UTXO flushing.  So I recommend
#you set the sum of these to nothing over half your available physical
#RAM:

    #HIST_MB = 300
        #amount of history cache, in MB, to retain before flushing to
        #disk.  Default is 300; probably no benefit being much larger
        #as history is append-only and not searched.

    #UTXO_MB = 1000
       #amount of UTXO and history cache, in MB, to retain before
       #flushing to disk.  Default is 1000.  This may be too large
       #for small boxes or too small for machines with lots of RAM.
       #Larger caches generally perform better as there is
       #significant searching of the UTXO cache during indexing.
       #However, I don't see much benefit in my tests pushing this
       #too high, and in fact performance begins to fall.  My
       #machine has 24GB RAM; the slow down is probably because of
       #leveldb caching and Python GC effects.  However this may be
       #very dependent on hardware and you may have different
       #results.
